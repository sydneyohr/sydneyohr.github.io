## Spatial Data in R

See Spatial data notes in the online manual for basics of CRS and spatial data types.


### Exercise 1 - Download Shapefiles


Navigate to the following URLs to download the spatial data files we'll be using in this activity. Put these files in the `data` folder of your `04_adv_maps` folder.
  
- MN cities: <https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/loc-pop-centers>
  - File type: shapefile (`.shp`)
  - File name: `shp_loc_pop_centers.zip` (Unzip this after downloading.)
  
- MN water: <https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-water-lakes-rivers>
  - File type: shapefile (`.shp`)
  - File name: `shp_water_lakes_rivers.zip` (Unzip this after downloading.)

### Exercise 2  - Read in Files

Read in the MN cities and MN water shapefiles by entering the correct relative paths in `st_read()`. **Tab completion will be very helpful here: type part of a directory or file name and hit tab to autocomplete or bring up a dropdown of options.**

```{r reading}
# The sf package comes with a North Carolina shapefile:
nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))

# Read in shapefiles just downloaded
mn_cities <- st_read("~/Desktop/COMP212/class_activities/04_adv-maps/data/shp_loc_pop_centers/city_and_township_population_centers.shp")
mn_water <- st_read("~/Desktop/COMP212/class_activities/04_adv-maps/data/shp_water_lakes_rivers/LakesAndRivers.shp")
```



The `sf` package reads in spatial data in `data.frame`-like format. Using the `class()` function we can check the **class** (type) of object that we just read in. Note the presence of the "sf" and "data.frame" classes:

```{r check_class_sf}
class(nc)
class(mn_cities)
class(mn_water)
```




When we read in spatial objects, it is useful to check what CRS underlies the data. We can do that with `st_crs()` from the `sf` package:

```{r check_nc_crs}
st_crs(nc)
```

We can treat `sf` objects similarly to ordinary datasets when using `ggplot2` to make spatial visualizations:

```{r nc_first_map}
ggplot(nc) +
    geom_sf() +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(title = "NAD27")
```

### Exercise 3 - Change CRS

Let's explore how changing the CRS changes the map. The `st_transform()` function in `sf` re-expresses a spatial object using a user-supplied CRS. The `crs` argument takes a string descriptor of the CRS. We can find these descriptors via <https://epsg.io>. In the example below, I searched for "South Carolina".

```{r transform_nc}
nc_transformed <- nc %>% st_transform(crs = "EPSG:32133")
st_crs(nc_transformed)
ggplot(nc_transformed) +
    geom_sf() +
    theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "South Carolina")
```

The goal is to use <https://epsg.io> to **find two CRSs** that result in a North Carolina map that is noticeably different from the original in the NAD27 CRS.

Take a look at the **function** below that re-maps a spatial object using a new CRS.

- Read through the function to get a sense for how this code works.
- `spatial_obj` and `new_crs` are called **arguments** (function **inputs**).
    - Add one more argument called `title` to this function. Use this input to set the plot title.
- Use your function to make two new maps using your chosen CRSs.

```{r transform_via_function}
transform_and_plot <- function(spatial_obj, new_crs) {
    spatial_obj %>% 
        st_transform(crs = new_crs) %>% 
        ggplot() +
            geom_sf() +
            theme_classic()
}

# Example usage of this function (using a South Carolina CRS)
transform_and_plot(nc, new_crs = "EPSG:32133")






```

**Verify your understanding:** If you had point location data that was not in the NAD27 CRS, what would you expect about the accuracy of how they would be overlaid on the original North Carolina map?

## MN map with multiple layers

**Goal:** create a map of MN with different layers of information (city point locations, county polygon boundaries, rivers as lines and polygons, and a raster elevation map).

### Exercise 4 - Get county boundaries

We've already read in city location and water information from external shapefiles. We can access county boundaries with the `us_counties()` function in the `USAboundaries` package.

```{r read_county_data}
# Load country boundaries data as sf object
mn_counties <- USAboundaries::us_counties(resolution = "high", states = "Minnesota")

# Take care of duplicate column names (there are two identical "state_name" columns)
names_counties <- names(mn_counties)
names(mn_counties)[names_counties == "state_name"] <- c("state_name1", "state_name2")
```

### Exercise 5 -  Unifying CRSs across different spatial datasets

We first need to ensure that the CRS is the same for all spatial datasets.

- Check the CRS for the `mn_cities`, `mn_water`, and `mn_counties` datasets.
- If the datasets don't all have the same CRS, use `st_transform()` to update the datasets to have the same CRS as `mn_cities`. You can use `crs = st_crs(mn_cities)` within `st_transform()`.



```{r unify_crs}
# Check CRSs
st_crs(mn_cities) #NAD83
st_crs(mn_water)
st_crs(mn_counties)


# Transform the CRS of county data to the more local CRS of the cities

mn_counties <- st_transform(mn_counties, crs = st_crs(mn_cities))


# Check the new CRS for mn_counties
st_crs(mn_counties)


```



### Exericse 6 - counties and cities

Create a map where city locations are overlaid on a map of county boundaries.

- You will need to call `geom_sf()` twice.
- Make the map background white.
- Install the `ggthemes` package, and add the following layer to use a clean map theme: `+ ggthemes::theme_map()`



```{r initial_mn_map}

ggplot(mn_counties) +
    geom_sf() +
    theme_classic()

```



### Exericse 7 - Customize Colors

We can use traditional `ggplot2` aesthetics (e.g., `fill`, `color`) to display location specific attributes. Below we only plot large cities, and we color and size cities according to their population.

```{r mn_map_add_color}
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = "white") + 
    geom_sf(data = mn_cities %>% filter(Population >= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer
    scale_color_viridis_c() + # continuous (gradient) color scale
    labs(title = "Minnesota Cities with Population >= 10,000") + 
    ggthemes::theme_map() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") # move legend
```

Look up the `scale_color_viridis_c()` documentation via the [ggplot2 reference](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html).

- Read the function description at the top. What is the advantage of using this function for making color palettes?
- Look through the examples section. What is the difference between the `_d()`, `_c()`, and `_b()` variants of this function?








### Exercise 8 - Adding elevation raster data

Where are large cities located? Is there some relationship to local geography/terrain? To investigate these questions, we can obtain elevation data to include on the map using the `elevatr` package. We encounter two new functions here---we can look up their documentation to make sense of the code by entering the following in the Console:

- `?elevatr::get_elev_raster`
- `?terra::as.data.frame`

```{r get_elevation_data_zoom_out}
elevation <- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties, z = 5, clip = "bbox")
raster::crs(elevation) <- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)

# Convert to data frame for plotting
elev_df <- elevation %>% terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)
colnames(elev_df) <- c("x", "y", "elevation")
```

Build on our existing map by adding a raster layer for elevation as the background.

- Look up the documentation for `geom_raster()` to plot the elevation data from `elev_df`. This will be the first layer of the plot.
- Look at the documentation for `scale_fill_gradient()` to add the following elevation color scale: `"darkgreen"` represents the lowest elevations, and `"white"` represents the highest elevations.
- Add in the layers from the map above to show the largest cities and the county outlines. To remove a background color, use `fill = NA`.



```{r elevation_map_zoom_out}


```



### Exercise 9 - Zoom in to Twin Cities and add water

The bulk of the interesting information in this map is in the Twin Cities area. Let's zoom in to this area.

- We can use the `st_bbox()` function to get the **bounding box** for a spatial object---we do this after filtering to the 7 counties in the Twin Cities.
- We then use `st_crop()` to trim a spatial object to a given bounding box.

```{r get_elevation_data_zoom_in}
seven_countyarea <- mn_counties %>%
    filter(name %in% c("Anoka", "Hennepin", "Ramsey", "Dakota", "Carver", "Washington", "Scott")) %>% 
    st_bbox()
seven_countyarea

elevation <- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties %>% st_crop(seven_countyarea), z = 9, clip = "bbox")
raster::crs(elevation) <- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)

# Convert to data frame for plotting
elev_df <- elevation %>% terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)
colnames(elev_df) <- c("x", "y", "elevation")
```

In the plot below, we add a layer for water information and a `coord_sf()` layer to restrict the x and y-axis limits to the Twin Cities bounding box. (Without this layer, the map would zoom back out to show all counties and bodies of water).

```{r elevation_map_zoom_in}
ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + 
    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = "black") + # county boundary layer
    geom_sf(data = mn_water, fill = "lightsteelblue1", color = "lightsteelblue1") + # NEW: river/lake layer
    geom_sf(data = mn_cities %>% filter(Population >= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer
    scale_color_viridis_c(option = "magma") + # continuous (gradient) color scale
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "darkgreen", high = "white") + # continuous (gradient) fill scale
    coord_sf(xlim = seven_countyarea[c("xmin", "xmax")], ylim = seven_countyarea[c("ymin", "ymax")]) + # NEW: crop map to Twin Cities bounding box
    labs(title = "Twin Cities with Population >= 10,000") + 
    ggthemes::theme_map() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") # remove legend
```

Let's add to the above code chunk to save the map above to an image file called `tc_map_zoom.png` in the `results` folder. The code example below shows a general template for saving a plot to file. Choose a reasonable width and height. (There are also `jpeg()` and `pdf()` functions for writing images.)

```{r save_plot_example}
png("relative path to image", width = width_in_pixels, height = height_in_pixels)
# Code for creating plot
dev.off()
```


### Going Beyond - Twin Cities map with `leaflet`

Below we show how to make the MN counties map in the `leaflet` package.

```{r leaflet}
library(leaflet)

mn_counties_leaf <- mn_counties %>% st_transform(4326) # Leaflet expects this CRS for vectors
mn_cities_leaf <- mn_cities %>% st_transform(4326)

cities_per_county <- st_join(mn_cities_leaf, mn_counties_leaf) %>%
    st_drop_geometry() %>% # removes geometry - makes the following calculation more efficient
    count(name) 

mn_counties_leaf %>% 
    filter(name %in% c("Anoka", "Hennepin", "Ramsey", "Dakota", "Carver", "Washington", "Scott")) %>%
    left_join(cities_per_county) %>%
    leaflet() %>% 
    addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>% 
    addPolygons(
        color = "#444444", weight = 1, smoothFactor = 0.5, opacity = 1.0,
        fillOpacity = 0.5, fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", n)(n),
        highlightOptions = highlightOptions(color = "white", weight = 2, bringToFront = TRUE)) %>%
    addCircles(data = mn_cities_leaf %>% filter(County %in% paste(c("Anoka", "Hennepin", "Ramsey", "Dakota", "Carver", "Washington", "Scott"), "County")), color = "#444444")
```
